What do I do? I solve problems using data. I currently work as a Data Scientist developing Artificial Intelligence solutions to solve complex problems and improve customer experience. I also experienced developing business intelligence reports, and developing data-related products, acting as a data product manager.   

Besides, I am passionate about teaching. I had worked as an Adjunct Professor during my Master's degree. Currently, I am acting as Master in Business Administration (MBA) Tutor and Professor, in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence courses (graduate courses).   

Finally, I am always studying new artificial intelligence techniques, because "the joy of thinking and learning makes us think and learn even more" _(Aristotle)_.
