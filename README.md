What do I do? I solve problems using data. I currently work as a Data Scientist developing Artificial Intelligence solutions to solve complex problems and improve customer experience. I also experienced developing business intelligence reports, and developing data-related products, acting as a data product manager.   

Besides, I am passionate about teaching. I had one year and a half as an teacher assistant during my Master's degree. Now, I am a Tutor in a Master of Business Administration (MBA) of Data Science.   

Finally, I am studying artificial intelligence techniques and algorithms. I like to explore new technologies because "the joy of thinking and learning makes us think and learn even more." _(Aristotle)_
