What do I do? I solve problems using **data insights**! Currently, I work as a data analyst developing dashboards for internal and external stakeholders, as well as in development data-related products, acting as a product manager.   

Besides, I am studying artificial intelligence techniques and algorithms. I like to explore new technologies because "the joy of thinking and learning makes us think and learn even more." _(Aristotle)_
