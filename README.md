What do I do? I use data to solve problems. I currently work as a Machine Learning Engineer developing Artificial Intelligence solutions to solve complex problems and improve customer experience. I also experienced work as a Data Scientist and Data Analyst. In addition to my core role, I wear a Team Lead hat, guiding and inspiring fellow professionals. 

Besides, I am passionate about teaching. I worked as an Adjunct Professor during my Master's degree. Currently, I am acting as a Master of Business Administration (MBA) Tutor and Professor, in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence courses (graduate courses).   

Finally, I am always studying new artificial intelligence techniques, because "the joy of thinking and learning makes us think and learn even more" _(Aristotle)_.
