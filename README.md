As Principal MLOps Engineer, I use data to solve problems and improve customer experiences with Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions. I have experience as a Data Scientist and Data Analyst, which helps me approach challenges from different angles. I also lead a team, focusing on mentoring and supporting new fellows. 

I love teaching as well. I worked as an Adjunct Professor during my Master and PhD programs and now teach graduate courses in Data Science and AI as an MBA Tutor and Professor. My aim is to help the next generation of data professionals while continuing to grow in this exciting field.   

I believe in continuous learning, always exploring new AI techniques. As Aristotle said, "The joy of thinking and learning makes us think and learn even more."
